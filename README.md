# Tiny ImageNet to Coarse

This project aims to create a subset of Tiny ImageNet dataset and label it in order to have a structure of coarse and fine labels similar to CIFAR-100. The resulting dataset will consist of 25 fine labels and 5 coarse labels, with 5 fine labels assigned to each coarse label.

## Dataset

The Tiny ImageNet dataset is a popular benchmark for image classification tasks. However, it lacks a hierarchical label structure like CIFAR-100. This project addresses that by filtering the Tiny ImageNet dataset and assigning coarse and fine labels to the images.
